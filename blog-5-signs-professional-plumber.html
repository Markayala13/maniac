        <h1>5 Signs You Need a Professional Plumber</h1>

        <p>Knowing when to call a professional plumber can save you thousands in water damage and repairs. Here are five clear signs that it's time to call PlumbManiacs Inc.</p>

        <h3>1. Persistent Low Water Pressure</h3>
        <p>If you notice low water pressure throughout your home, this could indicate pipe corrosion, hidden leaks, or mineral buildup. While one clogged faucet is fixable, consistent low pressure needs professional diagnosis.</p>

        <h3>2. Multiple Slow or Clogged Drains</h3>
        <p>One clogged drain might be simple, but multiple slow drains mean you likely have a serious issue in your main sewer line from tree roots, buildup, or damaged pipes.</p>

        <h3>3. No Hot Water or Inconsistent Temperature</h3>
        <p>Water heater problems can indicate failing heating elements, sediment buildup, or thermostat issues. These involve both water and electrical components - call a professional.</p>

        <h3>4. Water Stains or Mold Growth</h3>
        <p>Water stains on ceilings, walls, or floors signal hidden leaks. Mold growth means moisture problems that need immediate attention to prevent structural damage and health hazards.</p>

        <h3>5. Strange Noises from Pipes</h3>
        <p>Banging, gurgling, or whistling sounds indicate problems like water hammer, venting issues, or worn valves that can damage your plumbing system over time.</p>
