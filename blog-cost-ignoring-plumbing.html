        <h1>The True Cost of Ignoring Plumbing Problems</h1>

        <p>What starts as a small leak or slow drain can snowball into a major disaster. Understanding the real costs of procrastination helps you make smart repair decisions.</p>

        <h3>How Small Problems Escalate</h3>
        <p>Plumbing problems get worse over time. A drip wastes water and increases bills monthly. Moisture creates perfect conditions for mold. Continuous water exposure weakens surrounding materials. Partial clogs stress entire pipe systems.</p>

        <h3>Hidden Costs You Don't See</h3>
        <p>The most dangerous aspect is hidden damage behind walls and under floors. Water rots wooden structures, weakens drywall, damages subflooring, and can cause foundation problems. Mold can begin growing within 24-48 hours and requires expensive remediation.</p>

        <h3>Common Problems That Get Expensive</h3>
        <p><strong>Dripping Faucet:</strong> Wastes thousands of gallons yearly, wears out fixtures faster, and may indicate spreading pipe corrosion.</p>
        <p><strong>Slow Drain:</strong> Often leads to complete blockages, creates bacteria growth and odors, and may signal tree roots in your sewer line.</p>
        <p><strong>Small Leak Under Sink:</strong> Rots cabinet materials, creates mold in enclosed spaces, and can lead to pipe bursts.</p>

        <h3>Insurance Won't Always Cover It</h3>
        <p>Many insurance companies won't cover damage from "neglected maintenance." Gradual leaks and damage from lack of maintenance are typically excluded. You may need to prove the problem was sudden and unexpected.</p>

        <h3>The Smart Decision</h3>
        <p>The best time to fix a plumbing problem is when you first notice it. Early intervention is always cheaper than emergency repairs. Don't let small problems become big disasters.</p>
